                        We browse the Internet in search of interesting and informative content, 
                        which we usually find in the form of plain text. To accompany this plain text, 
                        HTML provides ways to embed rich media in the form of images, audio tracks,
                        of and videos, as well as to embed content from another web page in the form
                        an inline frame.

                        The ability to include images, audio tracks, videos, and inline frames within
                        websites has been around for some time. Browser support for images and inline frames
                        has generally been pretty good. And while the ability to add audio tracks and videos 
                        to a website has been around for years, the process has been fairly cumbersome. Fortunately,
                        this process has improved and is much easier with support directly from HTML.
